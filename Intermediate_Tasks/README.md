# ðŸš€ Intermediate Tasks

This folder contains the intermediate-level tasks completed during the YoungDev Intern â€“ Artificial Intelligence Internship.

## ðŸ“‚ Task Overview
### ðŸŽ¨ Task 01 â€“ Website Design (Figma)

- Designed a modern website layout in Figma, later used as a reference for the Expert Tasks.
- Focused on clean UI/UX, structured sections for:
    - Home
    - Prediction
    - Results
    - Categories
    - Footer

### ðŸ¤– Task 02 & 03 â€“ Fake Job Post Detection (Combined)

Since both tasks were closely related, they were implemented in a single notebook for efficiency.

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 02 â€“ Data Analysis & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical features
- Cleaned job descriptions (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 03 â€“ Model Training & Evaluation

- Built a Random Forest Classifier for fake job post detection
- Evaluated with:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
-Achieved strong results with good generalization capability

### âœ¨ Highlights:

- UI/UX Design with Figma
- Real-world dataset preprocessing
- Machine Learning Model (Random Forest)
- Strong results with practical application
